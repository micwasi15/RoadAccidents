# Analysis of Road Accident Fatalities in Europe (2019)

## Description

This project analyzes the number of fatalities in road accidents across European regions in 2019.  
The analysis focuses on relationships between accident deaths and several factors, including:

- Region
- Number of cars per 1,000 inhabitants
- Average fines for traffic violations
- Share of vehicles older than 10 years

The goal was to uncover correlations that could help understand factors influencing road safety.

This project was developed as part of university coursework at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- GeoPandas

## Project Structure

- `/Datasets/` — raw and cleaned datasets
- `/Scripts/` — Python scripts for data preprocessing and visualization
- `Road_accidents.pdf` — full project report (in Polish)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn geopandas
   ```
3. Open and run the Scripts/main.py.

## Additional Information
The complete analysis and conclusions are available in the Road_accidents.pdf file (written in Polish).

The project includes basic machine learning modeling using linear regression and polynomial regression to predict fatalities based on various factors.
